## Overview
Contents for my [personal blog](https://jimmyau.com). The pages are generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). However, instead of manually editing Markdown files, editing is mostly done in [Forestry](https://forestry.io).

## Try Me

Make sure you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed. If not, follow this [official guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start).

### Editing (with live reload)
```
hugo server
```
Navigate to http://localhost:1313 to see the site.

### Generating the Site
```
hugo
```
By default, the generated site will be located in the `public` directory, which you can then deploy.
